% Overview of functions of the luminanceMeter/Minolta Toolbox% The Minolta LS-110 luminance meter has a serial (RS-232) output% which can be read by any computer that you can  connect a modem to.% This toolbox contains routines to do this using matlab% on a macintosh (or a pc).% Note that these routines are not provided by Minoltaª% so don't contact them about it.% You'll need to buy or make a connector cable that can be plugged% into the Minolta on one side and on the other side a% Macintosh or PC serial connector. The basic operations to achieve% this are simple and explained below.%% closeLuminanceMeter.m% getLuminance.m% initLuminanceMeter.m% luminanceMeterTest.m% measurelut.m% selectSerialPort.m% luminanceMeter.m%% Part of Minolta toolbox% Send comments and bug reports to: f.w.cornelissen@med.rug.nl% *************************************************************************	% no time to %%% the rest out and tidy this.....Making a cable:The basic idea is that you connect the data out to the receive data pin of the computer, and use the DTR (data terminal ready) line of the serial port to send measurement requests. We'll keep the busy line high all the time (so the meter immediately outputs the data), by connecting the busy line (black) to the +5v (yellow). The last thing to do is to GND the meter to one of the GND's of the computer.You'll have to get a RP17-13P-12PC connector to connect your computer to the Minolta. Minolta offers this connector only as part of a special cable (about $40), perhaps a good electronics store might carry it too). The colours refer to this special cable.Minolta pin lay out (Hirose RP17-13RA-12SD connector). Pin#	Function			Wire Colour1		GND					brown2		GND3		Busy				black4		n.c.5		External power6		Null offset7		n.c.8		Data out			red9		n.c.10		Clock out11		Measurement request12		+5v 				yellowHere's how to create a minolta to mac connector (thanks to Hiro Akutsu for figuring this out):Mac1	RTS & DTR2	CTS3	TD (transmit)4	GND5	RD (receive)6	??7	CD8	GND Minolta #1 or Minolta#2 to Mac Modem port #4 (GND). Minolta #8 (Data out) to Mac 's #5 (receive). Minolta #11 (measurement request) to Mac #1 (DTR) Minolta #3 to #12 (busy to +5V) (keep's busy signal high)In my own setup I use a Minolta to RS232 9 PIN D-Connector, and connect that to the mac via a 9  pin to a DB25 pin converter, and then to the mac via a standard modem cable. In this way, we can use the cable also to connect the meter to pc's.RS232 9 PIN connections:pin1 (DCD)2 (RD)3 (TD)4 (DTR)5 (GND)6 (DSR)7 (RTS)8 (CTS)9 (??)Here's how to create a minolta to a standard 9 PIN D-Connector: Minolta #1 (brown) or Minolta#2 to pin 5 (GND) Minolta #8 (red) (Data out) to to pin 2 (receive). Minolta #11 (white) (measurement request) to pin 4 (DTR) Minolta #3 (yellow) to #12 (black) (busy to +5V) (keep's busy signal high)According to Eric van Wijk you also need to do this:On RS232 plug:  7 to 8 (RTS to CTS)  1 to 6 and also to 4 (DCD to DSR to DTR)I haven't checked this, but he got it working, so I guess it's okay.************************************************************************
